Maybe this should be in general

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacs
  :init
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'text-scale-increase)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C--") 'text-scale-decrease)
  )
#+end_src

* Dimming
TODO dimmer-fraction need to be dependent on the theme: lighter themes
need larger numbers. The default, 0.2 is ok for dark themes

Popup buffers are not ideal either. Things like *Apropos*, I'd like them
not to be dimmed when they pop up, but they should be dimmed when one
goes away from them. Maybe the right behavior is not to exclude them,
havng them selected with a 'q' binding for burying them.

Autocompletion is also not perfect. It shouldn't dim the buffer we're
completing from. Too distracting. Maybe the exclusion predicate would
work for this.
